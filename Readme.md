# Tips 
- Never show code or anything to prove how complicated your method is in the first slide or page (Follow deepmind)
- Always start with a picture that depicts the solution or work done in a short example. (gifs are a great way to do this)
- Talk about the complicated aspect in the third slide 
- Let the first be a very basic approach yet something that isnt readily available
- The second slide be a small improvement and then the third slide a novel idea that solves the problem well
